'''6.Extract the links

Write a program that extracts links from a given text. The text will come in the form of strings, each
representing a sentence. You need to extract only the valid links from it. Example:

&quot;www.internet.com&quot;

Sub-Domain Domain name Domain

extension

The Sub-Domain must always be &quot;www&quot;. The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters
(uppercase and lowercase), digits and dashes (&quot;â€“&quot;). The Domain extension consists of one or more
domain blocks, a domain block consists of a dot followed by one or more lowercase English alphabet
letters, a Domain extension must have at least one domain block in order to be valid. The Sub-Domain
and Domain name must be separated by a single dot. Any link that does NOT follow the specified above
rules should be treated as invalid.
